## 🏗️ Python Construction & Logic Programming Practice

This repository contains categorized Python problems designed for hands-on learning — from **real-world construction calculations**, to **intermediate logic using lists/dictionaries**, to **advanced string and array algorithm prep**.

---

### 📦 Modules & Topics Covered:

---

### 1. 🧱 **Construction Utilities with Functions**

Learn to apply arithmetic and logic to real-world construction scenarios.

**Key Functions:**

* Labor scheduling, material cost, tank filling time
* Daily wages, paint estimation, tool rental checks
* Windows/tiles calculation, budget feasibility

**Focus:** Arithmetic, conditions, return values

---

### 2. 🔁 **Intermediate Python (Lists & Dictionaries)**

Work with real-world worker/material tracking using dictionaries and loops.

**Highlights:**

* Track daily output and summarize logs
* Check material sufficiency
* Sort/filter/group workers by role or output
* Compare materials across two sites
* Top-N laborer extraction logic

**Focus:** Loops, dictionary access, sorting/grouping logic
